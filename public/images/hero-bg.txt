This is a placeholder for the hero background image file.
In a real implementation, you would place an actual image file (e.g., jpg, png) here.

For now, we're using the existing corgi.jpg image, but ideally you would replace it with:
- A high-resolution tech/coding themed image
- A dark modern background showing code or technology
- A video showing app development/deployment process

Recommended image dimensions: 1920x1080px minimum
Optimal format: WebP or JPEG with good compression
